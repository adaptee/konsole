/**
 * A widget which allows users to search incrementally through a document for a

 *
 * The widget consists of a text box into which the user can enter their search text and
 * buttons to trigger a search for the next and previous matches for the search text.
 *
 * When the search text is changed, the searchChanged() signal is emitted.  A search through
 * the document for the new text should begin immediately and the active view of the document
 * should jump to display any matches if found.  setFoundMatch() should be called whenever the
 * search text changes to indicate whether a match for the text was found in the document.
 *
 * findNextClicked() and findPreviousClicked() signals are emitted when the user presses buttons
 * to find next and previous matches respectively.
 *
 * The first indicates whether searches are case sensitive.
 * The matchCaseToggled() signal is emitted when this is changed.
 * The second indicates whether the search text should be treated as a plain string or
 * as a regular expression.
 * The matchRegExpToggled() signal is emitted when this is changed.
